# deck-notify.sh - harness stop-hook helper. On turn-finish it sends an ntfy
# push whose click-through opens the deck session that launched the agent.
#
# deck stamps DECK_SESSION_ID into every agent it spawns (claude / pi / codex),
# and passes its own environment through, so anything you export where you start
# deck reaches this script. It builds <DECK_BASE_URL>/s/<id> and hands ntfy a
# Click header for the deep-link. Wire it up per harness in docs/hooks.md.
#
# Everything comes from the environment, so no secret lives in the repo:
#   DECK_SESSION_ID  set by deck for agents it launched (unset otherwise)
#   DECK_BASE_URL    your deck origin, e.g. https://your-deck-host:4818
#   NTFY_TOPIC       ntfy topic to publish to (or set NTFY_URL for a full URL)
#   NTFY_TOKEN       optional bearer token for a protected topic
#
# Harnesses hand stop hooks extra data (claude on stdin, codex as a JSON
# argument). This script ignores both and reads only the environment.
